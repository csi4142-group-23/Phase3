Project Phase 3 - Classification

Classification. Employ a classification algorithm (e.g. decision
tree, support vector machine, lazy learner, ensemble, etc.) to explore the
data.

*Construct a model to determine the characteristics of accidents that
occurred when road surfaces were not dry. That is, consider only the
instances when the road surfaces were wet, had loose or packed snow,
were icy or covered with slush*
